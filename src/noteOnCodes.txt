* State and observation vectors as column vectors or row vectors

Some matlab functions, for example , r = mvnrnd(MU,SIGMA,cases) returns
row vectors, while most textbooks define state and observation vectors 
as column vectors.

mvnrndWrapper and mvnpdfWrapper returns column vectors.

[Ref]
r = mvnrnd(MU,SIGMA,cases), where MU is a n-by-d matrix, 
SIGMA is a d-by-d symmetric positive semi-definite matrix, and 
cases is a scalar, returns a cases-by-d matrix R of random vectors.

muS = [0 ; 0]
sysSigma = [1 0.5; 0.5 1.1]
mvnrnd(muS, sysSigma )

For example, elements of a system noise are 
state(1, :) = [state11, state12]
